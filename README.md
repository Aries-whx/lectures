## Notes:

[9 Feb, 2019] How to implement ResNet blocks (slides 70-71, 74 in [lecture 4](https://github.com/lse-st449/lectures/blob/master/Week04/lse-st449-lecture4.pdf)) in TensorFlow? See ResNet implementation in TensorFlow [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/resnet), in particular, [resnet_model.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/resnet/resnet_model.py), e.g. `inputs + shortcut` in `_building_block_v2()`.
